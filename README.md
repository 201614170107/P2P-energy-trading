Evaluating the impact of peer-to-peer energy trading on the distribution grid

For ilustrative purposes we designed an electricity network model conformed by a 20kV/410V tranformer of 160 kVA rated power, two feeders with aluminium power lines of 240 mm2 and neutral of 95 mm2, following the specifications for french distribution grids as described in http://www.enedis.fr/sites/default/files/Enedis-PRO-RES_43E.pdf.

The file 33H_17PV_DistributionNetwork-DSS_base.DSS can be used with the OpenDSS Distribution system simulation tool for Power flow analysis.
